# Revise Website Accessibility

## Description

This challenge was to revise the provided webpage to fulfill accessibility standards.
I began by checking the html for alt attributes and adding these in. 
I then tested the functionability of the buttons to check that the links were working correctly
I checked the semantics of the HTML and replaced them with more efficient/relevant options
I learnt that I need to be much more methodical and tidy with the way I approach a project
